Public Policy
=============
I think it is always interesting to talk about the political differences between countries. For that reason, we have included 
a bit of information on the similarities and differences between policy in the U.S. and England.

Things you should know for your visit
-------------------------------------
* The vast majority of police officers do not carry guns in England. Only a small force, that gets called in for special situations, carries guns. Every police officer that a law abiding tourist will encounter will not have a gun. This policy has actually been credited with reducing crime and improving the relations between the police and communities.

* You have access to healthcare if you get sick during your visit. Even people who are not registered with the public healthcare system have access to free clinics for up to six months and prescription medication that costs just about 10 dollars.

* Speaking of prescriptions, you do not need to go to a pharmacy in England; the doctor will give it to you.

* Marijuana is illegal in England just like in most of the United States. But you can use Europe's low cost air travel to go to The Netherlands for less than 30 dollars.

Some key differences
--------------------
**Healthcare**

England offers a public option for healthcare. What this entails is the government offering health insurance alongside with some private insurance 
companies. Only 11 percent of citizens opt out of the public option and use private insurance. The public option is significantly cheaper than 
private insurance as it eliminates the profit margin and legal fees between the provider and consumer.

**Media**

England hosts one of the best rated media outlets, that being BBC. BBC is a publically funded media organization that provides fuller coverage 
of real news compared to the corporate media in the U.S. - although if you only care about what Donald Trump tweets, then maybe CNN is for you. 
So how is it paid for? Well BBC is almost entirely funded by a TV tax. Since the people pay for it, it better covers things that affect them.

**Higher Education**

College education is largely subsidized by the government in England. Lower income people will likely pay next to nothing for higher education in England. And even 
wealthier people will pay a set max of about 11,400 dollars for a year. The average cost is roughly 7,500 dollars per year. The average cost per year in the U.S. 
is 11,0522 dollars at a two year public school or 18,943 dollars at a four year public school.

**Elections**

Elections in England only last about 4 weeks as opposed to more than a year and a half in the U.S. Additionally there are spending limits on individuals 
in England as well as a total spending limit of about 33 million dollars per party.

**Brexit**

You may have heard a great deal about Brexit and how questionable of a decision it was. The European Union has been responsible for the development and 
prosperity of numerous European countries, so why did The British People decide leave? One main theory is that there is a cultural divide, particularly in 
the immigration policies of the EU. The other main theory is that working class people have been left behind by the trade policies of the EU. Personally I 
think the second reason is more relevant; when people are not doing well economically, they will vote for change. And that is exactly what the working class 
voted for in Brexit. To address the cultural divide, I think people would be more willing to accept multiculturalism if the economy worked for everyone. The 
economy affects all other issues or as James Carville said, "it's the economy stupid".
