Transportation in London
========================

Driving in London
-----------------
With the exception of a few standards, driving in London is similar to driving in any major American city. 
First let's cover the key differences. In London, the standard is to drive on the left hand side of the road. 
While this sounds terrifying, the reality is that the United Kingdom's driving system is simply the inverse of the 
American system. So, the driver will actually be on the right hand side of the car. This way you are still positioned 
to be closest to the center of the road. Also know that on the highway you will exit and enter on the left hand side instead of the right. 
Ok so it sounds pretty different, what is actually the same?
 
The main similarity between driving in London and a major American City is that it's a bad idea in general. Just like in Chicago or New York, 
London is super congested with obnoxious, impatient drivers. Any attempt to drive in London is surely an attempt to raise your stress levels 
to a much unneeded height. The solution of course is to utilize London's phenomenal public transportation system.


Public Transportation
---------------------
Public transportation is leagues faster than driving and London offers a variety of public transportation. To start, London hosts a 
a state of the art subway and rail system. This works like any other subway; it's cheap and fast. More unique is the river bus transportation 
in London. It's just like it sounds, you use the river as your road. It's not as fast but it is a very smooth and enjoyable ride. Lastly, 
you can ride on one of these sweet double decker buses.

While buses are slower than the rail system, they offer a wide variety of pick-up and drop-off points. Where ever you need to go in London, 
there is a bus stop.
