Weather

Description
-----------
The weather in England is largely influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, the weather will be cold and cloudy almost the entire year.
Additionally, there is a lot of wind and precipitation year round. The wind is caused by the cold fronts of the Atlantic meeting
the slightly less cold fronts of the mainland combined with the general lack of wind blocking obstacles in the ocean.
The precipitation is a result of evaporation off of the Atlantic. Even in the few warm months of Summer, overcast and thunderstorms
still rule the region. Simply speaking, England is known to be one of the gloomiest places on the planet.

Justification
-------------
Ok so maybe London doesn't sound like the best vacation spot now. Well the line of reasoning that a vacation spot should be warm and pretty is frankly 
stupid. The supposedly miserable weather of the region has its benefits. One very tangible benefit is that being in the cold burns more calories; 
some people can come back from vacation tan while you can come back looking slim and fit. Another advantage is that the cold is deprived of insects- 
a very good perk, especially if you don't believe in vaccines. And one more undervalued benefit is that the cold brings people together, 
both physically but also emotionally. Studies show that we communicate longer and more in depth with each other when we are in a cold environment.
